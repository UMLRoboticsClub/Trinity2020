How to connect to the router

---
### Router

We use a wireless router with an SSID of "Velociraptor" to communicate with our robot.

* The wifi login is: Velociraptor:umlroboticsclub
* The web interface login is admin:umlrobotics @ 192.168.1.1

We will set up a static IP for the VIM3 soon.

### SSH
At the moment, the VIM3 is accessible via the SSH logins:

* root:trinity
* [etc...]:trinity

Feel free to add your SSH keys.
